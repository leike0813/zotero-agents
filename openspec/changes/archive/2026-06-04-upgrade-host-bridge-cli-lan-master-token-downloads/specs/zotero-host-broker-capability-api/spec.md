## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Host Bridge LAN mode requires a fixed port

- **THEN** Host Bridge reports an error
- **AND** it does not disable fixed port mode or select a random port

### Requirement: Host Bridge accepts master token authentication
Host Bridge MUST accept either the current local token or the configured master token as bearer auth.

#### Scenario: Master token auth
- **WHEN** a request uses the current master token
- **THEN** protected endpoints authorize successfully

### Requirement: File download manifest declares remote support
The manifest MUST describe file downloads as bearer-authenticated and remote-client compatible.
