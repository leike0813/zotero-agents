## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Remote Host Bridge profiles use stable master tokens
Remote CLI documentation and generated profile examples MUST support a profile containing a LAN endpoint and a master bearer token.

#### Scenario: User copies remote profile
- **WHEN** LAN access is configured with a fixed port and master token
- **THEN** the copied profile contains `endpoint` and `auth.token`
- **AND** the endpoint uses the advertised host or `<zotero-host-ip>` placeholder

### Requirement: File download command works with remote profiles
The CLI file download command MUST continue to accept only broker-issued file ids and MUST work when the configured endpoint is remote.

#### Scenario: Remote endpoint configured
- **WHEN** a profile points to `http://<host>:<port>/bridge/v1`
- **THEN** `file download <fileId>` calls `GET /files/{fileId}` with bearer auth
- **AND** it does not accept local filesystem paths as file ids
