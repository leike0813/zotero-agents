## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Rust CLI calls the Host Bridge
The system SHALL provide a Rust `zotero-bridge` CLI contract that communicates with the plugin Host Bridge over HTTP JSON using UTF-8 request bodies.

#### Scenario: CLI sends non-ASCII JSON without corruption
- **WHEN** the CLI sends JSON input containing non-ASCII text
- **THEN** the Host Bridge SHALL decode the request body as UTF-8 bytes selected by `Content-Length`
- **AND** the capability handler SHALL receive the original text without mojibake.
